# galaxy-guide - Simple Java Application, which uses Little Language Pattern 

* this demo application is an example of simple test-driven java development, without any third-party libraries usage, except JUnit.
It' a Multi-Currency Converter for different Galaxies, in essence.
This application can be used as a basis for any quick test-driven prototype, when it is needed to be concentrated on data structure
and business logic. When I needed to quickly set up a simple file IO and junit test-driven environment, I found out that I
only have heavy-weight environments with REST services, relational databases and javascript libraries. So I quickly set up this simple program
to use it as a basis in the future.
