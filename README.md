# galaxy-guide - Multi-Currency Converter for different Galaxies

* This demo application is a simple Java application that applies Little Language Design Pattern. It is an example of a simple test-driven java development, without any third-party libraries usage, except JUnit.

* This application can be used as a basis for any quick test-driven prototype, when it is needed to focus on data structure and business logic. When I needed to quickly set up a simple file IO and junit test-driven environment, I found out that I only have heavy-weight environments with REST services, relational databases and javascript libraries. So I quickly set up this simple program to use it as a basis in the future.
